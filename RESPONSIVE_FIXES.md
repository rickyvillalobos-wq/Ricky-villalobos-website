# Mobile Responsiveness Fixes Applied

## Overview
Fixed mobile layout breaking issues and implemented consistent responsive design across all screen sizes.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Problematic Mobile CSS
- **Removed**: Aggressive `!important` overrides that were hiding content
- **Removed**: Mobile-specific content hiding (hero backgrounds, images)
- **Removed**: Hard-coded breakpoints that caused layout jumps
- **Removed**: "MOBILE MODE ACTIVE" debug overlay

### 2. Implemented Mobile-First Responsive Design

#### Base Responsive Utilities
```css
- All images: max-width: 100%, height: auto
- All elements: box-sizing: border-box
- Body: overflow-x: hidden (prevents horizontal scroll)
```

#### Screen Size Breakpoints
- **Small Mobile**: ≤ 480px
- **Mobile/Tablet**: ≤ 768px  
- **Tablet**: ≤ 1024px
- **Desktop**: > 1024px

#### Typography Scaling
- Used `clamp()` for fluid typography that scales smoothly
- Hero h1: `clamp(2rem, 6vw, 3rem)`
- Body text: `clamp(1.1rem, 3vw, 1.3rem)`
- Section headers: `clamp(2rem, 5vw, 2.5rem)`

### 3. Grid Layout Improvements
